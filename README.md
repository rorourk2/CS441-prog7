The goal of the game is to keep the knight alive for as long as possible. 
You can click to move the knight in a new direction
the four fire balls will bounce around the screen and will send you to the leader board screen if they hit you.
The leader board records the games score if it is in the top 10.

8/4 - created repository and moved project wrapper into the new repository

8/7 - created a main menu connecting to the game

8/8 - began adding game objects setups

8/9 - added movement and lose conditions. Added in the animation. Fixed the bug with the Leader Board that had it print out scores in the wrong order.
